- Briefly explain the vulnerability and why the secure version prevents the vulnerability.
    The vulnerability in the insecure server is the fact that the mongodb query uses user input directly in the query to the _id field and any non-string characters in the query causes an error that crashes the server.
    The secure version of the server addresses this vulnerability by adding error handling such that the error caused by the non-string query to a mongodb database can be handled without crashing the server.
- What additional security mechanisms can you incorporate to prevent such attacks?
    Sanitizing the user input is still an important method to preventing threats, even though mongodb has built in security.
    Also implementing a rate-handling middleware can prevent any attacks that try to overwhelm the server with a very large number of requests in a short span of time
